Project Overview

Overview

Name: Hype Squad - The First Polish DAO
Brief Description: A brief description of your project.
Relationship to EOSIO: Our market research has shown that even chains with top 10 market cap can be scam. We want to promote and educate people about long-term projects that are not cash grabs or pozni. Security and amount of transactions per second will win over other chains. These reasons convinced us to EOSIO.
Reason for Interest: We've deep interested in Web 3.0 for a long time, and we believe EOSIO is worth passing it. We provide educational content about web3 to new users under 25 years old, so it's crucial to make content and educate new people in web3 about good long-term projects.


Project Details

We are building the first polish DAO community around blockchain and Web3 technology on various social media channels - Twitch, Discord, Twitter, etc. The main idea is to bring blockchain closer to the people, and at the beginning, members will not know that they are using blockchain to form, vote, and decide about the community's future. So the first part is to make the community use blockchain technology without knowing it's some new technology.

I agreed with Warsaw government entities to host around 1h presentation in 100 high schools in Warsaw about Web3 - it will be the leading way to reach out to new DAO members and future blockchain users at the beginning. It gives me around 500 students and 50 teachers reach per school - 55000 in total.
Lectures will start in January 2023.

The first acquisition of the members will be grapevine in the web3 community, the next presentation at schools, and giveaways. After we reach a certain point of members, we will start influencers marketing (lives, interviews, etc)

We have already made partnerships with the biggest communities and web3 projects in Poland and we will announce it in Q1-Q2

We spread the adoption of new technologies and the new order of society like DAO.

The main goal is to build a community around web3 education in Poland. Poland community in Web3 is one of the biggest in Europe, so we will minimalize entry barriers for them.
Another main point is contact production. We will produce content daily on various social media channels to be easy to consume for people of every age, but we are mainly focused on young people - future web3 users. We will present health and sports apps for members who are into sports. We will introduce the games sector for gamers etc. And on top of that will be a DAO organization, so every member, no matter what interests him/her they, will be using blockchain technology.


Ecosystem Fit

In Poland, there are a lot of people who want to enter the web3 world but the knowledge is really hard to find and we need more educational materials right now.
The main goal is education around: knowledge, career, business development, and investment. The project is set up for the long term, and we are presenting a plan for first 12 months.
Benefits:

Brand new community members and users
New projects and initiatives in web3 because people will understand the idea and possibilities
New ideas and acquisition of young talents - faster growth
People start investing in web3 startups, tokens, NFT, Gamefi, DeFi, metaverse, and new technology.
